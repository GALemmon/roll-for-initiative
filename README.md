## Overview

Hail and well met, traveler! Roll for Initiative is a turn-based brawler featuring the mythical monsters and courageous heroes from the Dungeons and Dragons (DnD) universe! Engage in single combat against one of five unique monstrous foes using one of the three playable classes from classic DnD: Fighter, Cleric, or Rogue.

Roll for Initiative is played using a modified DnD 5th edition ruleset by: rolling a 20 sided dice for initiative, using class-unique bonus actions such as Multi Attack, Healing Word, and Sneak Attack, and striking down your foes with might and cunning. Not familiar with DnD? Check out the how to play page on the homescreen for a detailed description of the mechanics, or just dive in and experience the simple joys of Dungeons and Dragons.

Gain victory over your opponents or choose to fight again reclaim your lost glory. Your fate is cast by the dice!

## Project Goals

This is the "stretch tech" group project for Mod 3 at Turing School of Software and Design where students were tasked with choosing new techology to include in a unique application. The goals of Roll for Initiative were to self-teach TypeScript while collaborating in a team setting and sharpening our skills with React and Router.
